## About The Nerd King

I have been a software engineer for over 20 years, and I love all things related to technology.  I started writing code on my Commodore64 when I was 8 years old, and never looked back.  Today, I have a 7-yr old daughter that is following in my footsteps with technology and I spent a lot of time working on Minecraft related projects to entertain the two of us!

## What I'm Listening To

## Current Projects

I am currently working on a few things

- [ ]  Tinkerign with my profile, adding some more cool stuff like the Spotify widget above.

- [ ] Consolidating all of the Minecraft forks on my profile into an Organization I created.

- [ ] Collaborating with @crowbarmaster to add some new functionality to [BedrockManagementService](https://github.com/crowbarmaster/BedrockManagementService)
